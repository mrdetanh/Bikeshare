### Project Title
	Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
	This project analyzes bikeshare data from several major cities in the United States (Washington, New York City, and Chicago) to uncover usage patterns, peak travel times, and demographic trends among users. 
	The analysis is conducted using Python, with a focus on leveraging libraries such as pandas for data manipulation. The goal is to provide insights that can inform city planning, improve bike-sharing systems, and better understand user behavior.

### Files used
	- `bikeshare.py`: The main script that performs the data analysis.
	- `chicago.csv`: Dataset containing bikeshare data for Chicago.
	- `new_york_city.csv`: Dataset containing bikeshare data for New York City.
	- `washington.csv`: Dataset containing bikeshare data for Washington.
	- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

### Credits
	This project was inspired and guided by the coursework provided by [Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)
