### Project Title
	Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
	This project analyzes bikeshare data from several major cities in the United States (Washington, New York City, and Chicago) to uncover usage patterns, peak travel times, and demographic trends among users. 
	The analysis is conducted using Python, with a focus on leveraging libraries such as pandas for data manipulation. The goal is to provide insights that can inform city planning, improve bike-sharing systems, and better understand user behavior.

### Files used
	- `bikeshare.py`: The main script that performs the data analysis.
	- `chicago.csv`: Dataset containing bikeshare data for Chicago.
	- `new_york_city.csv`: Dataset containing bikeshare data for New York City.
	- `washington.csv`: Dataset containing bikeshare data for Washington.
	- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

### Installation Instructions
	To run the `bikeshare.py` script, follow the steps below:

	1. **Ensure you have Python 3 installed**:
   		- You can download the latest version of Python from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   		- Alternatively, you can install Python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which includes Python and many common libraries.

	2. **Install necessary libraries**:
   		- This project requires the `pandas` library, which can be installed using pip:
     		```bash
     		pip install pandas
     		```
   		- If you're using Anaconda, the library may already be installed. If not, you can install it with:
     		```bash
     		conda install pandas
     		```

	3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   		- Open your terminal (Terminal on macOS/Linux, or Git Bash on Windows).
   		- Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the `bikeshare.py` file is located.
     		```bash
     		cd path/to/your/Bikeshare
     		```

	4. **Run the script**:
   		- Once you are in the correct directory, run the script using Python:
     		```bash
     		python bikeshare.py
     		```
   		- Follow the on-screen prompts to analyze the bikeshare data.
